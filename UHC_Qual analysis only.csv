Intervention,No,No,It was challenging,
Intervention,No,No,It was interesting to see the different categories that are considered when talking about health benefits and it was hard to pick which ones were more important because I feel like all of them are essential to some extent ,

There are many people who make a living by working for these insurance companies, but there are also people who need health insurance but lack the money to do so.",
Intervention,No,No,It's hard for me to think about people having to pick and choose which parts of healthcare they'll have access to when they're all important. It makes me wish healthcare would be reformed for the good of everyone and not just those who can afford it.,
Intervention,No,No,it makes me realize that our health care system is messed up and makes me realized that our country do not care about the welfare of its people.,

Intervention,No,No,Eye opening ,
Intervention,No,No,I think it shows how much compromise is really needed for healthcare and you have to decide what you think is the most important. ,
Intervention,No,No,I liked it because you got to pick what type of insurance is important to you based on your beliefs and to what extinct you would like to be covered. I think it's somewhat realistic because not everyone taking this survey will have the same amount of money/funds available for health insurance in reality but overall forms a good idea of how sacrifices have to be made when deciding on health care,
Intervention,No,No,benifical,
Intervention,No,No,benifical,
Intervention,No,Yes,it's important,
Intervention,No,No,Doesn't change anything for me,

Intervention,No,No,straightforward,
Intervention,No,No,honestly im just doing it to pass the class im in,
Intervention,No,No,eye opening,
Intervention,No,No,What i got was what i got. If I have more money then i expect to get better health care than those that don't. There is a order to things and health care is not an exception.,

Intervention,No,No,interesting,
Intervention,No,No,Health care is very much needed for some whether the more wealthy are paying for it or not.,
Intervention,No,No,It made me realize its hard to get all the coverage you want.,
Intervention,No,No,i really don't know,
Intervention,Yes,No,I think healthcare and insurance should be given to any and all people but penalizing people for buying their own private plan is absurd,
Intervention,No,No,fun,
Intervention,No,No, The exercise was good to understand where our money is lead to in certain categories for health care in our systems and what categories could be more important than others ,
Intervention,No,Yes,Everyone should have access to some type of health care ,
Intervention,No,No,ok,
Intervention,Yes,No,Puts things in perspective that I haven't thought about before.,
Intervention,No,No,This study seemed to be rather limited to one position on the issue of universal health care.There are valid arguments on both sides of this issue and the wording of these questions says otherwise. ,
Intervention,No,No,I don’t feel very confident because I don’t know a lot about insurance or healthcare. ,
Intervention,No,Yes,This is very eye opening to the values that you have to take in to concideration with what you want covered.,
Intervention,No,Yes,It sucked to have to determine some parts of my health are less important than others so I couldn't score it as high as I would like.,
Intervention,No,No,It feels like it shouldn't be this easy,
Intervention,No,Yes,interesting,
Intervention,No,No,It was difficult to choose between everything because they are all important to me. ,
Intervention,No,No,informative ,
Intervention,No,No,informative ,
Intervention,No,No,"I thought that it was interesting for me to be able to design my own health care plan, but in reality there is no way a plan like mine would be able to go through.",
Intervention,No,Yes,"It showed me (...again) that money hungry companies do not care for basic human rights, they would rather capitalize off of it.",

Intervention,Yes,No,Very interesting,
Intervention,No,No,"America has a wack health system, I walked to the hospital instead of getting an ambulance kind of garbage.",
Intervention,No,No,I liked creating my own health care plan. It is a good exercise to see your health care standards.,
Intervention,No,No,I think it is important because avoiding the doctor because of a lack of universal healthcare is dangerous and inhumane.,
Intervention,Yes,No,Too complicated for such a short study,
Intervention,No,No,It was eye opening and interesting to try and cover what is needed within the budget. ,
Intervention,No,No,"I feel that although Universal Healthcare may pose some difficulties, I still think it would be beneficial. Everyone has different needs, so if we spread the funding out, I think it could work. I personally do not need much care, other than mental health and pharmacy, but I know there are many people who need more, and they should be able to get the care they need.",
Intervention,No,No,It helped me understand how insurance is spread out among many different parts of the healthcare system. ,
Intervention,No,No,I found it to be informative,
Intervention,No,No,Eyeopening ,
Intervention,No,No,great,
Intervention,No,Yes,You can get full coverage if you just choose basic coverage.,

Intervention,No,No,Realized that it will cost a lot of money so only the bare eseentials for not-as-important things don't need to be prioritized ,

Intervention,Yes,Yes,It’s hard to cover for everything that could be necessary and there are pitfalls in healthcare with anything less then a universal system. ,

Control,No,No,"Great questions, really makes us think about healthcare in a way we might not have before. ",
Control,No,Yes,The graphics were a great informational pieces to read and learn new information from. ,
Control,No,No,very interesting ,
Control,No,No,"Although I know health care is not fairly accessable to everyone, the statistics are quite an eye opener. ",
Control,No,No,Made me realize more people than I thought don’t have access to healthcare and it is very unfair.,
Control,No,Yes,"I think that ideally, every human being would be able to have great healthcare coverage. However, coming from a family that exploited the benefits of the 2013 Affordable Healthcare Act, I feel as though there has not been a way in which UHC has been implemented to where it will not cause many families, like mine, to handicap themselves and to remain unemployed. I completely believe that UHC is the best option morally, but in reality I feel that there has not been a way to where it will work to better America or a lot of its people in the way it sounds that it would.",
Control,Yes,No,useful,
Control,No,No,I think that it is very important for everyone to have medical/health insurance. I think that more people need to be educated on the subject before they make their opinions. ,

Control,No,No,I now have a much better understanding of Universal Healthcare and its goals.,
Control,No,Yes,"Still confused about most parts. I think that the health care system is awful, however I do not want tax money removed from my paycheck to pay for people that are not working to receive the same benefits as everyone else that actually work.",
Control,No,No,I found it interesting with the statistics but in the end my mind didn't change too much on the topic. I think it was unfair to show only benefits to universal healthcare without explaining what it would take to get there. ,
Control,No,No,I think health care is a really important topic of conversation that isn't discussed in as much urgency as it should be.,
Control,No,No,I think it expanded my knowledge on health care,
Control,No,No,There was a lot of statistics regarding people around the globe but I thought this was gonna be about the US. Also none of the images really explained what universal health care was or how it would be implemented.,
Control,No,Yes,crazy how many people are uninsured,
Control,No,No,it enhanced my perspective that universal healthcare needs to be implemented,
Control,No,Yes,I think that universal health insurance isn't the answer to fighting the hefty medical bills Americans face.  I think that the solution is to make medical supplies less expensive (for example: Epi pens should not be like $200).  The government needs to put regulations on Big Pharma.,
Control,Yes,Yes,Not very effective,
Control,No,No,I enjoyed it,
Control,No,Yes,The exercise was very informative on the problems with health care and why they need to be fixed.,
Control,No,No,"I really hope that some of the people that take this survey feel stronger about how healthcare is a basic human right, and it made me angry that it will take up to 2030 to possibly reach the goal. This should've been done years ago.",
Control,No,No,"I appreciate being given infographics about healthcare. My views did not change much before and after, however.",
Control,No,No,I found it very informative,
Control,No,No,Informative,
Control,No,No,I think the as you go through each page it attempts to convince the read of UHC's importance. The ratings at the beginning and end of the survey shows the change of opinion after an individual is taught more about UHC.,
Control,Yes,Yes,I felt that the prompts I read did not change my opinions much,
Control,No,Yes,Very interesting. The infographics definitely helped me learn more. ,
Control,No,No,Really enjoyed the infographics and very easy to understand.,
Control,No,No,I think it's very informative.,
Control,No,Yes,Universal healthcare is very clearly an absolute necessity and anyone who says otherwise after being presented with the facts is either feigning ignorance or places little to no value on human life.,
Control,No,Yes,interesting,
Control,Yes,Yes,"Universal Health Care is a topic I am very passionate about and I was pleased to be apart of this study. I hope that one day we will have Universal Health Care. I was wondering however, will the pay of doctors be reduced if this was put into place? I had a heated debate with one of my good friends and in their argument they stated that if the pay is less it might give doctors less of an incentive to pursue their fields because of how excruciating medical school is. If you can respond to this I would greatly appreciate it you can email me at ashkmw@umsystem.edu Thank you very much",
Control,No,No,great informational graphics,
Control,No,No,i thought it was good,
Control,No,No,"Universal healthcare has many pros and cons & it's not a simple concept. I realized I wasn't as educated, on this subject, as I thought.",

Control,No,No,The Healthcare system needs totally reformed. ,
Control,No,No,"I didn't know a lot of the statistics, every eye opening about the real world.",
Control,No,No,I noticed my answers slightly changed as I became more educated ,
Control,No,No,"It wasn't super enlightening, I felt like I already knew a lot about it. The information didn't make me want to support the Affordable Care Act more, just that something should be done. The information didn't tell me why the Affordable Care Act would be effective.",
Control,No,No,I found it interesting and insightful,
Control,No,Yes,It states the facts of the situation,
Control,No,No,It taught me a lot,
Control,No,No,Eye opening on the statistics shown in the given posters,

Control,No,No,It brought a lot of issues regarding health care to my attention. ,
Control,No,No,I like the idea of informing the less knowledgeable on UHC.,
Control,No,No,I think it was interesting to see the amount of people who do not have access to healthcare systems.,
Control,No,No,"It was very informative, I wasn't very educated on a lot of what I read so I'm really glad I took this survey, I didn't change most of my views about health care, but I feel much more educated on the issue",
Control,No,No,It was confusing,

Control,No,No,Support for universal health care,
Control,No,No,Eye opening. I have never really been taught about this kind of topic ,
Control,No,No,I thought that it taught me things I did not know.,

Control,No,No,Glad to learn that a good amount of people in the world receive health care regardless of their financial problems.,
Control,No,No,UHC will be incredibly difficult to finance.,
Control,No,No,I did not realize how many people are lacking proper healthcare. ,
Control,No,No,It was fine,
Control,No,No,Why should health care be free?,
Control,No,No,very informative,
Control,No,No,"It was informational but is biased. It gave no indication of the positives to our capitalist way of healthcare, such as being able to choose the healthcare/doctor's office/hospital/surgeons/care plan you want or need",

Control,No,No,It was very informative. ,

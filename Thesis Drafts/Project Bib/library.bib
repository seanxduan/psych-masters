abstract = {With regard to the spatial distribution of pictorial elements in (monomodal) visual (or pictorial) metaphor three types of metaphor can be distinguished: Similes (where the target and source are visually presented separately), Hybrids (where target and source are fused together) and Contextual Metaphors (where either source or target is visually absent). In an experiment using authentic advertisements, it is tested whether consumers' experience of deviation from expectation and complexity vary with regard to these three types of visual metaphor. Participants in Spain, France and the Netherlands took part in an Internet experiment. Results show that Hybrids are the preferred type of visual metaphor, that deviation from expectation and comprehension have a positive impact on appreciation, and that perceived complexity correlates negatively with appreciation. The effects for nationality are limited. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Mediation analysis has become a very popular approach in psychology, and it is one that is associated with multiple perspectives that are often at odds, often implicitly. Explicitly discussing these perspectives and their motivations, advantages, and disadvantages can help to provide clarity to conversations and research regarding the use and refinement of mediation models. We discuss five such pairs of perspectives on mediation analysis, their associated advantages and disadvantages, and their implications: with vs. without a mediation hypothesis, specific effects vs. a global model, directness vs. indirectness of causation, effect size vs. null hypothesis testing, and hypothesized vs. alternative explanations. Discussion of the perspectives is facilitated by a small simulation study. Some philosophical and linguistic considerations are briefly discussed, as well as some other perspectives we do not develop here.},

abstract = {Political rhetoric surrounding Universal Health Care in the United States typically deals only with differences in political ideology. Research on symbolic racism, however, indicates that subtle racial prejudice may also predict attitudes toward policies like universal health care that are assumed to benefit racial minorities. This subtle racial prejudice hypothesis was supported across three studies conducted in the U.S. A measure of attitudes toward universal health care was found to be a reliable, single-dimension measure associated with political ideology (Pilot Study). Subtle racial prejudice (as measured by the Modern Racism Scale) predicted opposition to universal health care, even when statistically controlling for political ideology and attitudes toward the poor (Study 1). Moreover, reading about a Black individual (compared to a White individual) receiving universal health care benefits reduced support for universal health care, even when statistically controlling for political ideology and right-wing authoritarianism (Study 2). Being a person who takes advantage of the system (e.g., free rides) was a significant predictor of universal health care attitudes while race was not (Study 3). This work demonstrates that subtle racial prejudice plays a critical role in predicting universal health care attitudes among U.S. citizens, reflecting a long-standing history of associations between subtle racial prejudice and opposition to governmental assistance programs in the U.S.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Nearly 46 million Americans did not have health insurance in 2004. Recent studies have documented physicians' support for various remedies, including universal health care. The authors undertook this study to assess medical students' views on these topics. METHOD: In 2002, the authors surveyed a national random sample of first-year and fourth-year medical students (from the American Medical Association Masterfile) to determine their views about health care reform options, including universal health care. Response data were weighted and compared using chi-squared tests; statistical significance was set at p ≤ .05. RESULTS: Of 1,363 medical students, 770 completed the questionnaire (response rate = 56.5{\%}). In rating the importance of several health care issues, more than 80{\%} of both first-year and fourth-year students rated the expansion of health care coverage as important. Nearly all first-year (90{\%}) and fourth-year (88{\%}) students agreed with the statement, "Everyone is entitled to adequate medical care regardless of ability to pay." Most students favored health care reform that would achieve universal health care, with first-year students (70{\%}) somewhat more likely than fourth-year students (61{\%}) to support universal health care (p = .012). Students were less likely to believe that physicians support universal health care, and more likely to believe that the public does. CONCLUSIONS: Both groups of students generally support the expansion of health coverage to the uninsured and some form of universal health care. This may be relevant both to policymakers in their considerations of health care reform and to medical educators concerned with teaching students about health policy issues.},

abstract = {A growing literature in comparative political economy and health economics has argued several cost-saving effects of a single-payer healthcare system. Despite this growing evidence, there has been no large-scale empirical examination of whether such an effect exists cross-nationally over time. This paper serves as the first attempt to find and calculate the extent to which healthcare spending is affected by the utilization of a single-payer scheme. I introduce an original dataset for OECD countries that measures when and where systems that qualify as single-payer exist, and employ it to test whether significant differences exist in health expenditures. Results demonstrate a significant difference between single- and multi-payer system expenditures. I estimate the utilization of a single-payer system is associated with decreased expenditure equal to 0.750 percentage-points of a nation's GDP. This would equate to the United States saving well over {\$}1.5 trillion over ten years.},

abstract = {Persistent pain interfering with daily activities is common. Chronic pain has been defined in many ways. Chronic pain syndrome is a separate entity from chronic pain. Chronic pain is defined as, "pain that persists 6 months after an injury and beyond the usual course of an acute disease or a reasonable time for a comparable injury to heal, that is associated with chronic pathologic processes that cause continuous or intermittent pain for months or years, that may continue in the presence or absence of demonstrable pathologies; may not be amenable to routine pain control methods; and healing may never occur." In contrast, chronic pain syndrome has been defined as a complex condition with physical, psychological, emotional, and social components. The prevalence of chronic pain in the adult population ranges from 2{\%} to 40{\%}, with a median point prevalence of 15{\%}. Among chronic pain disorders, pain arising from various structures of the spine constitutes the majority of the problems. The lifetime prevalence of spinal pain has been reported as 54{\%} to 80{\%}. Studies of the prevalence of low back pain and neck pain and its impact in general have shown 23{\%} of patients reporting Grade II to IV low back pain (high pain intensity with disability) versus 15{\%} with neck pain. Further, age related prevalence of persistent pain appears to be much more common in the elderly associated with functional limitations and difficulty in performing daily life activities. Chronic persistent low back and neck pain is seen in 25{\%} to 60{\%} of patients, one-year or longer after the initial episode. Spinal pain is associated with significant economic, societal, and health impact. Estimates and patterns of productivity losses and direct health care expenditures among individuals with back and neck pain in the United States continue to escalate. Recent studies have shown significant increases in the prevalence of various pain problems including low back pain. Frequent use of opioids in managing chronic non-cancer pain has been a major issue for health care in the United States placing a significant strain on the economy with the majority of patients receiving opioids for chronic pain necessitating an increased production of opioids, and escalating costs of opioid use, even with normal intake. The additional costs of misuse, abuse, and addiction are enormous. Comorbidities including psychological and physical conditions and numerous other risk factors are common in spinal pain and add significant complexities to the interventionalist's clinical task. This section of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP)/Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines evaluates the epidemiology, scope, and impact of spinal pain and its relevance to health care interventions.},

abstract = {Importance: The United States spends more on health care than any other country, with costs approaching 18{\%} of the gross domestic product (GDP). Prior studies estimated that approximately 30{\%} of health care spending may be considered waste. Despite efforts to reduce overtreatment, improve care, and address overpayment, it is likely that substantial waste in US health care spending remains. Objectives: To estimate current levels of waste in the US health care system in 6 previously developed domains and to report estimates of potential savings for each domain. Evidence: A search of peer-reviewed and "gray" literature from January 2012 to May 2019 focused on the 6 waste domains previously identified by the Institute of Medicine and Berwick and Hackbarth: failure of care delivery, failure of care coordination, overtreatment or low-value care, pricing failure, fraud and abuse, and administrative complexity. For each domain, available estimates of waste-related costs and data from interventions shown to reduce waste-related costs were recorded, converted to annual estimates in 2019 dollars for national populations when necessary, and combined into ranges or summed as appropriate. Findings: The review yielded 71 estimates from 54 unique peer-reviewed publications, government-based reports, and reports from the gray literature. Computations yielded the following estimated ranges of total annual cost of waste: failure of care delivery, 102.4 billion to 165.7 billion; failure of care coordination, 27.2 billion to 78.2 billion; overtreatment or low-value care, 75.7 billion to 101.2 billion; pricing failure, 230.7 billion to 240.5 billion; fraud and abuse, 58.5 billion to 83.9 billion; and administrative complexity, 265.6 billion. The estimated annual savings from measures to eliminate waste were as follows: failure of care delivery, 44.4 billion to 93.3 billion; failure of care coordination, 29.6 billion to 38.2 billion; overtreatment or low-value care, 12.8 billion to 28.6 billion; pricing failure, 81.4 billion to 91.2 billion; and fraud and abuse, 22.8 billion to 30.8 billion. No studies were identified that focused on interventions targeting administrative complexity. The estimated total annual costs of waste were 760 billion to 935 billion and savings from interventions that address waste were 191 billion to 282 billion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this review based on 6 previously identified domains of health care waste, the estimated cost of waste in the US health care system ranged from 760 billion to 935 billion, accounting for approximately 25{\%} of total health care spending, and the projected potential savings from interventions that reduce waste, excluding savings from administrative complexity, ranged from 191 billion to 282 billion, representing a potential 25{\%} reduction in the total cost of waste. Implementation of effective measures to eliminate waste represents an opportunity reduce the continued increases in US health care expenditures..},

Before the reforms, Turkey's aggregate health indicators lagged behind those of Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) member states and other middle-income countries. Less than 70 percent of the population was insured, and even those with insurance did not have adequate access to timely health services (Akdağ 2011). The health financing system was fragmented, with four separate insurance schemes and a “Green Card” program for the poor, each with distinct benefits packages and access rules. Both the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the Ministry of Health (MoH) were providers and financiers of the health system, and four different ministries were directly involved in public health care delivery.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A frequently cited obstacle to universal insurance is the lack of consensus about what benefits to offer in an affordable insurance package. This study was conducted to assess the feasibility of providing uninsured patients the opportunity to define their own benefit package within cost constraints. DESIGN: Structured group exercises. SETTING: Community setting. PARTICIPANTS: Uninsured individuals recruited from clinical and community settings in central North Carolina. MEASUREMENTS: Insurance choices were measured using a simulation exercise, CHAT (Choosing Healthplans All Together). Participants designed managed care plans, individually and as groups, by selecting from 15 service categories having varied levels of restriction (e.g., formulary, copayments) within the constraints of a fixed monthly premium comparable to the typical per member/per month managed care premium paid by U.S. employers. MAIN RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four individuals who were predominantly male (70{\%}), African American (55{\%}), and socioeconomically disadvantaged (53{\%} earned {\textless}{\$}15,000 annually) participated in 22 groups and were able to design health benefit packages individually and in groups. All 22 groups chose to cover hospitalization, pharmacy, dental, and specialty care, and 21 groups chose primary care and mental health. Although individuals' choices differed from their groups' selections, 86{\%} of participants were willing to abide by group choices. CONCLUSIONS: Groups of low-income uninsured individuals are able to identify acceptable benefit packages that are comparable in cost but differ in benefit design from managed care contracts offered to many U.S. employees today.},

The U.S. has the highest chronic disease burden and an obesity rate that is two times higher than the OECD average. Americans had fewer physician visits than peers in most countries, which may be related to a low supply of physicians in the U.S. Americans use some expensive technologies, such as MRIs, and specialized procedures, such as hip replacements, more often than our peers. The U.S. outperforms its peers in terms of preventive measures — it has the one of the highest rates of breast cancer screening among women ages 50 to 69 and the second-highest rate (after the U.K.) of flu vaccinations among people age 65 and older. Compared to peer nations, the U.S. has among the highest number of hospitalizations from preventable causes and the highest rate of avoidable deaths.},

Design and Methods: Structured group exercises were conducted with Medicare enrollees from clinical and community settings in central North Carolina. By participating in a decision exercise, CHAT: Choosing Healthplans All Together, individuals and groups chose medical benefits within the constraints of a monthly Medicare + Choice premium. The acceptability of the exercise and the resulting benefit package were assessed. Results: Ten groups (121 individuals) made trade-offs that involved the selection of more tightly managed care in order to add pharmacy, dental, and long-term care benefits. All were willing to forgo experimental therapy; 7 groups gave priority to insuring the uninsured. Participants found the exercise overwhelmingly acceptable and were willing to abide by their groups' choices. Implications: Medicare enrollees are able to come to consensus about financially constrained benefit packages that may be useful in reform of the Medicare program.},

abstract = {Fully implemented in Thailand in 2002, the Universal Health Care Coverage (UC) Program aimed to provide cheap access to health care services, for 30 baht (less than 1 U.S. dollar) per visit, to all uninsured Thais. In this paper, we studied the impact of the UC in Thailand on the demand for health care services using hospital level data. We found that the UC program was successful in increasing outpatient demand for health care, particularly the demand from the elderly and the poor. However, outpatient demand for health care dramatically increased during the first year of the program and faded away quickly in subsequent years. In contrast to outpatient demand, the number of inpatient visits and the number of days for which the inpatients were admitted at hospitals declined after the UC program was launched. In this paper, we offer our explanation of these phenomena, highlight problems associated with the UC program, and provide policy recommendations to improve the program. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {As of 2007, an estimated 62{\%} of individual bankruptcy filings in the United States were a direct result of costs borne from medical treatment following illness or injury, up from 46{\%} in 2001. This pressing issue is only getting worse and is in need of relief. In this work, we consider the potential of a relatively recent, and rapidly growing, phenomenon to mitigate the problem: online crowdfunding for medical expenses, wherein patients reach out to their social network for monetary support via online platforms that facilitate the process. On the surface, medical crowdfunding holds the potential to address insurance gaps and to help those burdened by medical debt. However, recent questions have arisen in the healthcare literature around fairness and equity in the distribution of funds. Consistent with the notion of digital divide, many have raised concerns that the individuals most likely to benefit from these services are not the individuals who are most in need. Accordingly, we first seek to establish the effect of this novel phenomenon on a key indicator of financial distress: rates of personal bankruptcy. We then explore heterogeneity in patterns of funding solicitation and acquisition, to assess the presence inequalities across patient populations. We leverage proprietary data from a large medical crowdfunding platform based in the United States, which we combine with county records of personal bankruptcy filings. We report evidence that greater success amongst medical crowdfunding campaigns does translate into a reduction in personal bankruptcy filings. Subsequently, we report analyses which revealed evidence consistent with the presence of a digital divide. Specifically, we report evidence that disadvantaged groups are systematically more likely to launch medical crowdfunding campaigns, yet conditional on campaign launch, garner systematically less in funding. We discuss the implications for the literature on the digital divide, as well as implications for practice and policy.},

Production and quality of fruits and seeds as well as pollen tube growth were evaluated for each treatment. Experimental pollinations indicate that L. cestroides is self-incompatible since fruits were obtained only under cross-, and open-pollination treatments. However, in self- and geitonogamous hand pollinations, as well as in autonomous self-pollination, pollen tubes developed successfully and reached the ovules. The speed of pollen tube growth did not differ significantly among the different hand-pollinated flowers (cross-, self-, and geitonogamous). These facts indicate the presence of an ovarian self-incompatibility system. Significant differences were observed in fruit set, fruit size, and seed number per fruit between cross-pollinated flowers and open pollination (control). These results could be explained in terms of quantity and quality of pollination in each case},

The data was collected from 17 OECD countries between 1973 and 2000. Two public health outcome indicators, infant mortality rate and life expectancy at birth, were used as dependent variables. To analyze cross-country panel data, we used a mixed-effect model. A statistically significant association was found between government health expenditure and public health outcomes. Particularly, the findings showed a negative relationship between government health expenditure and infant mortality rate, and a positive relationship between government health expenditure and life expectancy at birth. The results suggest that higher government spending on medical goods and services can be shown to provide better overall health results for individuals. Based on these results, we discussed the policy implication of recent changes in healthcare policy in the United States as well as future research direction.},

abstract = {The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed by a Democratic Congress and signed into law by a Democratic president in 2010. Republican congressmen, governors, and Republican candidates have consistently opposed the ACA and have vowed to repeal it. Polls have consistently shown that it is supported by {\textless}50{\%} of Americans. The most important goal of the ACA is to improve the health of Americans by increasing the number covered by health insurance. In the first year of its implementation, more than 10 million citizens gained health insurance. The percentage of Americans without health insurance decreased from 18{\%} in July 2013 to 13.4{\%} in June 2014. In addition, the ACA has eliminated many of the negative features of private insurance such as the denial of coverage for those with "prior conditions." The benefits of Medicare have been enhanced to decrease the cost of prescription drugs and to eliminate co-pays for preventive services. Despite these positive changes, a near majority of Americans still oppose the ACA, even though they approve of most of its features. They oppose the mandate that all Americans must have health insurance (the individual mandate), and they oppose a government role in health care. Yet Medicare, a mandatory insurance for seniors administered by the federal government since 1965, is overwhelmingly approved by the American public. The opposition to a government role in health care is based on the fact that that the vast majority of our citizens do not trust their government. Republicans are much less trusting of the federal government and much less supportive of a government role in health care than Democrats. The overwhelmingly negative TV ads against the ACA by the Republican candidates in the elections of 2012 and 2014 have had a major impact on Americans' views of the ACA. More than 60{\%} of Americans have stated that most of what they know about the ACA came from watching TV. Opposition to a government role in health care and to mandatory health insurance makes it unlikely that the US will be able to insure that all of its citizens have ongoing access to health care in the near future.},

Study Design KID 2006 subpopulation of neonatal discharges was analyzed by weighted frequency distribution and multivariable logistic regression analyses for the outcome of death, adjusted for insurance status and other variables. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted for the outcomes mean adjusted length of stay and hospital charges. The death analysis was repeated with KID 2003 and 2009. Principal Findings Of 4,318,121 estimated discharges in 2006, 5.4 percent were uninsured. There were 17,892 deaths; 9.5 percent were uninsured. The largest risks of death were five clinical conditions with adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of 13.7-3.1. Lack of insurance had an AOR of 2.6 (95 percent CI: 2.4, 2.8), greater than many clinical conditions; AOR estimates in alternate models were 2.1-2.7. Compared with insureds, uninsureds were less likely to have been admitted in transfer, more likely to have died in rural hospitals and to have received fewer resources. Similar death outcome results were observed for 2003 and 2009. Conclusions Uninsured neonates had decreased care and increased risk of dying. {\textcopyright} Health Research and Educational Trust.},

Evidence can help address the demand side pressures (ie, pressures exerted by people who need care) faced by economies with high, middle, and low incomes, particularly in the context of transitioning towards (or sustaining) universal health-care coverage. Strong systems, as opposed to technology-based solutions, can drive the development and implementation of evidence-informed frameworks for prevention and management of cancer in an equitable and affordable way. For this to succeed, different stakeholders-including national governments, global donors, the commercial sector, and service delivery institutions-must work together to address the growing burden of cancer across economies of low, middle, and high income. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Health care spending in the United States is a major concern and is higher than in other high-income countries, but there is little evidence that efforts to reform US health care delivery have had a meaningful influence on controlling health care spending and costs. OBJECTIVE: To compare potential drivers of spending, such as structural capacity and utilization, in the United States with those of 10 of the highest-income countries (United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark) to gain insight into what the United States can learn from these nations. EVIDENCE: Analysis of data primarily from 2013-2016 from key international organizations including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), comparing underlying differences in structural features, types of health care and social spending, and performance between the United States and 10 high-income countries. When data were not available for a given country or more accurate country-level estimates were available from sources other than the OECD, country-specific data sources were used. FINDINGS: In 2016, the US spent 17.8{\%} of its gross domestic product on health care, and spending in the other countries ranged from 9.6{\%} (Australia) to 12.4{\%} (Switzerland). The proportion of the population with health insurance was 90{\%} in the US, lower than the other countries (range, 99{\%}-100{\%}), and the US had the highest proportion of private health insurance (55.3{\%}). For some determinants of health such as smoking, the US ranked second lowest of the countries (11.4{\%} of the US population ≥15 years smokes daily; mean of all 11 countries, 16.6{\%}), but the US had the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or obese at 70.1{\%} (range for other countries, 23.8{\%}-63.4{\%}; mean of all 11 countries, 55.6{\%}). Life expectancy in the US was the lowest of the 11 countries at 78.8 years (range for other countries, 80.7-83.9 years; mean of all 11 countries, 81.7 years), and infant mortality was the highest (5.8 deaths per 1000 live births in the US; 3.6 per 1000 for all 11 countries). The US did not differ substantially from the other countries in physician workforce (2.6 physicians per 1000; 43{\%} primary care physicians), or nursing workforce (11.1 nurses per 1000). The US had comparable numbers of hospital beds (2.8 per 1000) but higher utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (118 per 1000) and computed tomography (245 per 1000) vs other countries. The US had similar rates of utilization (US discharges per 100 000 were 192 for acute myocardial infarction, 365 for pneumonia, 230 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; procedures per 100 000 were 204 for hip replacement, 226 for knee replacement, and 79 for coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Administrative costs of care (activities relating to planning, regulating, and managing health systems and services) accounted for 8{\%} in the US vs a range of 1{\%} to 3{\%} in the other countries. For pharmaceutical costs, spending per capita was {\$}1443 in the US vs a range of {\$}466 to {\$}939 in other countries. Salaries of physicians and nurses were higher in the US; for example, generalist physicians salaries were {\$}218173 in the US compared with a range of {\$}86 607 to {\$}154126 in the other countries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The United States spent approximately twice as much as other high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the United States were largely similar to those in other nations. Prices of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals, and administrative costs appeared to be the major drivers of the difference in overall cost between the United States and other high-income countries. As patients, physicians, policy makers, and legislators actively debate the future of the US health system, data such as these are needed to inform policy decisions.},

abstract = {This article explores belief in political rumors surrounding the health care reforms enacted by Congress in 2010. Refuting rumors with statements from unlikely sources can, under certain circumstances, increase the willingness of citizens to reject rumors regardless of their own political predilections. Such source credibility effects, while well known in the political persuasion literature, have not been applied to the study of rumor. Though source credibility appears to be an effective tool for debunking political rumors, risks remain. Drawing upon research from psychology on 'fluency' - the ease of information recall - this article argues that rumors acquire power through familiarity. Attempting to quash rumors through direct refutation may facilitate their diffusion by increasing fluency. The empirical results find that merely repeating a rumor increases its power.},

abstract = {Background. Basic numeracy skills are necessary before patients can understand the risks of medical treatments. Previous research has used objective measures, similar to mathematics tests, to evaluate numeracy. Objectives. To design a subjective measure (i.e., self-assessment) of quantitative ability that distinguishes low- and high-numerate individuals yet is less aversive, quicker to administer, and more useable for telephone and Internet surveys than existing numeracy measures. Research Design. Paper-and-pencil questionnaires. Subjects. The general public (N = 703) surveyed at 2 hospitals. Measures. Forty-nine subjective numeracy questions were compared to measures of objective numeracy. Results. An 8-item measure, the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS), was developed through several rounds of testing. Four items measure people's beliefs about their skill in performing various mathematical operations, and 4 measure people's preferences regarding the presentation of numerical information. The SNS was significantly correlated with Lipkus and others' objective numeracy scale (correlations: 0.63-0.68) yet was completed in less time (24 s/item v. 31 s/item, P {\textless} 0.05) and was perceived as less stressful (1.62 v. 2.69, P {\textless} 0.01) and less frustrating (1.92 v. 2.88, P {\textless} 0.01). Fifty percent of participants who completed the SNS volunteered to participate in another study, whereas only 8{\%} of those who completed the Lipkus and others scale similarly volunteered (odds ratio = 11.00, 95{\%} confidence interval = 2.14-56.65). Conclusions. The SNS correlates well with mathematical test measures of objective numeracy but can be administered in less time and with less burden. In addition, it is much more likely to leave participants willing to participate in additional research and shows much lower rates of missing or incomplete data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.},

Attitudes toward universal access to medical care were examined to determine whether support for it among people opposed to government involvement in health care was modified by three proxy measures of self-interest: being uninsured, in poor health, or a high user of medical care. Methods. Data on support for universal access, attitudes toward government involvement in health care, and the indicators of self-interest were obtained from a representative sample of adult Oklahomans (n = 1547) surveyed between October 1992 and December 1994. Forced-order multiple regression with interaction terms was the data analysis technique. Results. People opposed to government involvement in health care were found to be less likely to favor universal access to medical care, but poor health, lack of insurance, and high usage of medical care moderated this effect. Conclusions. The findings support the view that antigovernment sentiment need not foreclose the public option for health policymakers. Other considerations such as self-interest may modify the effect of unfavorable attitudes toward government.},

abstract = {Research has demonstrated that individual differences in numeracy may have important consequences for decision making. In the present paper, we develop a shorter, psychometrically improved measure of numeracy-the ability to understand, manipulate, and use numerical information, including probabilities. Across two large independent samples that varied widely in age and educational level, participants completed 18 items from existing numeracy measures. In Study 1, we conducted a Rasch analysis on the item pool and created an eight-item numeracy scale that assesses a broader range of difficulty than previous scales. In Study 2, we replicated this eight-item scale in a separate Rasch analysis using data from an independent sample. We also found that the new Rasch-based numeracy scale, compared with previous measures, could predict decision-making preferences obtained in past studies, supporting its predictive validity. In Study, 3, we further established the predictive validity of the Rasch-based numeracy scale. Specifically, we examined the associations between numeracy and risk judgments, compared with previous scales. Overall, we found that the Rasch-based scale was a better linear predictor of risk judgments than prior measures. Moreover, this study is the first to present the psychometric properties of several popular numeracy measures across a diverse sample of ages and educational level. We discuss the usefulness and the advantages of the new scale, which we feel can be used in a wide range of subject populations, allowing for a more clear understanding of how numeracy is associated with decision processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

This paper compares single-payer models in the areas of revenue collection, risk pooling, purchasing, and social solidarity. Single-payer and multi-payer systems each have advantages which may meet countries' priorities for their health insurance system. Single-payer systems are usually financed more progressively, and rely on existing taxation systems; they effectively distribute risks throughout one large risk pool; and they offer governments a high degree of control over the total expenditure on health. Multi-payer systems sacrificce this control for a greater ability to meet the diverse preferences of beneficiaries. Several major reforms of single-payer insurance systems - expansion of the role of private insurance and transformation to a multi-payer system - are then described and illustrated using specific country examples. These reforms have been implemented with some success in several countries but face several important challenges. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Although cost is not mentioned explicitly in the comparative effectiveness legislation, the American College of Physicians and others have called for cost-effectiveness analysis — assess- ment of the added improvement in health out- comes relative to cost — to be on the agenda for comparative effectiveness research.1,2 This ap- proach has come under harsh criticism from some who view it as the first step in health care rationing by the government — that cost cutting will mean the withdrawal of expensive treatments with small (but still positive) benefits. Some poli- ticians have therefore tried to restrict any efforts to use comparative effectiveness to guide U.S. health care policy.3},

abstract = {CHAT (Choosing Healthplans All Together) is an exercise in participatory decision making designed to engage the public in health care priority setting. Participants work individually and then in groups to distribute a limited number of pegs on a board as they select from a wide range of insurance options. Randomly distributed health events illustrate the consequences of insurance choices. In 1999-2000, the authors conducted fifty sessions of CHAT involving 592 residents of North Carolina. The exercise was rated highly regarding ease of use, informativeness, and enjoyment. Participants found the information believable and complete, thought the group decision-making process was fair, and were willing to abide by group decisions. CHAT holds promise as a tool to foster group deliberation, generate collective choices, and incorporate the preferences and values of consumers into allocation decisions. It can serve to inform and stimulate public dialogue about limited health care resources. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by Duke University Press.},

abstract = {Objective. To determine whether the use of Aiding Risk Information learning through Simulated Experience (ARISE) to communicate conditional probabilities about maternal serum screening results for Down syndrome promotes more accurate positive predictive value (PPV) estimates and conceptual understanding of screening, compared with explicitly providing individuals with this information via numerical summary or icon array. Method. In experiment 1, 582 participants completed an online study in which they were asked to estimate the PPV and rate their attitudes toward a screening test when information was presented in either a description (required calculation of the PPV), explicit (PPV was provided and had to be identified), or an ARISE format (PPV was inferred through experience-based learning). In experiment 2, 316 participants estimated the PPV and rated their attitudes toward screening based on information presented in either an icon array (identify the icons that represent the PPV) or ARISE format. Results. In experiment 1, ARISE elicited the most accurate PPV estimates compared with the description and explicit formats, and both the explicit and ARISE formats led to more unfavorable attitudes toward screening. In experiment 2, both the icon array and ARISE resulted in similar PPV estimates; however, ARISE led to more negative attitudes toward screening. Conclusions. These findings suggest that ARISE may be superior to other formats in the communication of PPV information for screening tests. However, differences in the complexity of the formats vary and require further investigation.},

abstract = {Background The United States is the only high-income nation without universal, government-funded or -mandated health insurance employing a unified payment system. The US multi-payer system leaves residents uninsured or underinsured, despite overall healthcare costs far above other nations. Single-payer (often referred to as Medicare for All), a proposed policy solution since 1990, is receiving renewed press attention and popular support. Our review seeks to assess the projected cost impact of a single-payer approach. Methods and findings We conducted our literature search between June 1 and December 31, 2018, without start date restriction for included studies. We surveyed an expert panel and searched PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, and preexisting lists for formal economic studies of the projected costs of single-payer plans for the US or for individual states. Reviewer pairs extracted data on methods and findings using a template. We quantified changes in total costs standardized to percentage of contemporaneous healthcare spending. Additionally, we quantified cost changes by subtype, such as costs due to increased healthcare utilization and savings due to simplified payment administration, lower drug costs, and other factors. We further examined how modeling assumptions affected results. Our search yielded economic analyses of the cost of 22 single-payer plans over the past 30 years. Exclusions were due to inadequate technical data or assuming a substantial ongoing role for private insurers. We found that 19 (86{\%}) of the analyses predicted net savings (median net result was a savings of 3.46{\%} of total costs) in the first year of program operation and 20 (91{\%}) predicted savings over several years; anticipated growth rates would result in long-term net savings for all plans. The largest source of savings was simplified payment administration (median 8.8{\%}), and the best predictors of net savings were the magnitude of utilization increase, and savings on administration and drug costs (R2 of 0.035, 0.43, and 0.62, respectively). Only drug cost savings remained significant in multivariate analysis. Included studies were heterogeneous in methods, which precluded us from conducting a formal meta-analysis. Conclusions In this systematic review, we found a high degree of analytic consensus for the fiscal feasibility of a single-payer approach in the US. Actual costs will depend on plan features and implementation. Future research should refine estimates of the effects of coverage expansion on utilization, evaluate provider administrative costs in varied existing single-payer systems, analyze implementation options, and evaluate US-based single-payer programs, as available.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the R package mediation for conducting causal mediation analysis in applied empirical research. In many scientific disciplines, the goal of researchers is not only estimating causal effects of a treatment but also understanding the process in which the treatment causally affects the outcome. Causal mediation analysis is frequently used to assess potential causal mechanisms. The mediation package implements a comprehensive suite of statistical tools for conducting such an analysis. The package is organized into two distinct approaches. Using the model-based approach, researchers can estimate causal mediation effects and conduct sensitivity analysis under the standard research design. Furthermore, the design-based approach provides several analysis tools that are applicable under different experimental designs. This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model-based approach. We also implement a statistical method for dealing with multiple (causally dependent) mediators, which are often encountered in practice. Finally, the package also offers a methodology for assessing causal mediation in the presence of treatment noncompliance, a common problem in randomized trials.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare the effects of active and didactic teaching strategies on learning-and process-oriented outcomes. Design: Controlled trial. Setting: After-hours residents' teaching session. Participants: Family and Community Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics residents at two academic medical institutions. Interventions: We randomly assigned residents to two groups. One group received a didactic lecture on effective use of diagnostic tests; during this session, the teacher spent a full hour delivering content. The other group received the same content in a session structured to foster resident-to-resident interactions. In the latter session, the teacher spent only 30 minutes directly delivering content to residents. Measures and Main Results: We measured residents' knowledge about and attitudes toward the session content before, immediately after, and one month after each session. We measured residents' perceptions of engagement and session value immediately after each session. We employed blinded observers who used a structured instrument to observe residents' activities during each session. Both teaching methods led to improvements in residents' scores on both knowledge and attitude assessments. The amount of improvement was not statistically different between groups. Residents in the active learning session perceived themselves, and were observed to be, more engaged with the session content and each other than residents in the didactic session. Residents in the didactic session perceived greater educational value from the session compared to residents in the active session. Conclusions: We reduced the amount of time spent in teacher-driven content delivery by 50 percent and covered the same amount of content with no detrimental effects on knowledge acquisition or attitude enhancement. Teaching strategies that foster learner-to-learner interactions will lead to more active engagement among learners, however, these learners may value the session less. Further research is needed to explore learner perceptions of the teaching process and other outcomes of active learning in medical education.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy CRISPR editing of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) with adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AAV9) holds promise for sustained gene repair therapy for muscular dystrophies. However, conflicting evidence exists on whether AAV9 transduces MuSCs. To rigorously address this question, we used a muscle graft model. The grafted muscle underwent complete necrosis before regenerating from its MuSCs. We injected AAV9.Cre into Ai14 mice. These mice express tdTomato upon Cre-mediated removal of a floxed stop codon. About 28{\%}–47{\%} and 24{\%}–89{\%} of Pax7+ MuSCs expressed tdTomato in pre-grafts and regenerated grafts (p {\textgreater} 0.05), respectively, suggesting AAV9 efficiently transduced MuSCs, and AAV9-edited MuSCs renewed successfully. Robust MuSC transduction was further confirmed by delivering AAV9.Cre to Pax7-ZsGreen-Ai14 mice in which Pax7+ MuSCs are genetically labeled by ZsGreen. Next, we co-injected AAV9.Cas9 and AAV9.gRNA to dystrophic mdx mice to repair the mutated dystrophin gene. CRISPR-treated and untreated muscles were grafted to immune-deficient, dystrophin-null NSG.mdx4cv mice. Grafts regenerated from CRISPR-treated muscle contained the edited genome and yielded 2.7-fold more dystrophin+ cells (p = 0.015). Importantly, increased dystrophin expression was not due to enhanced formation of revertant fibers or de novo transduction by residual CRISPR vectors in the graft. We conclude that AAV9 effectively transduces MuSCs. AAV9 CRISPR editing of MuSCs may provide enduring therapy. Satellite cells are stem cells responsible for muscle repair and maintenance. Here, Nance et al. show that adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AAV9) efficiently transduced and edited satellite cells. Intravenous delivery of AAV9 CRISPR vectors to mdx mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, not only corrected dystrophin gene mutation in mature muscle cells but also in satellite cells. Importantly, the muscle regenerated from the edited satellite cells contained the CRISPR-corrected dystrophin gene and expressed the edited dystrophin protein. Satellite cell editing provides a means to achieve enduring muscle gene therapy that can meet the demands of muscle injury and maintenance throughout a patient's life.},

abstract = {BackgroundRwanda's community-based health insurance programme (Mutuelle de Sant{\'{e}}) has been the focus of several large studies and much debate in global health policy. Comprehensive insurance reform enacted in mid-2011 transformed Mutuelle de Sant{\'{e}} to a system of tiered premiums to make it more financially progressive and sustainable. Many governments in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia have studied Rwanda's approach, particularly mechanisms to achieve high coverage, which exceeded 90{\%} by 2010. We assessed the effect of different community-based initiatives on Rwanda's progress towards universal health-care coverage and increased use of health services.$\backslash$nMethodsWe reviewed Rwandan interventions developed for villages that have enabled the scale-up of Mutuelle de Sant{\'{e}}. We reviewed data from the Ubudehe database (proportion of people in each wealth category across districts), the Community Based Health Insurance database (coverage across districts), the preliminary National Health Accounts 2009—10 (out-of-pocket spending as a proportion of total health expenditure), and the Demographic and Health Survey 2010 (contacts per year and out-of-pocket spending).$\backslash$nFindingsOver the first decade, national Mutuelle de Sant{\'{e}} covered more than 90{\%} of the population, has reduced out-of-pocket spending for health from 28{\%} to 12{\%} of total health expenditure, and increased service use to 1{\textperiodcentered}8 contacts per year. A wealth categorisation programme (Ubudehe) was originally developed as a basic community target scheme, and modified after the 1994 genocide to enrol the most vulnerable citizens into national social protection programmes. It was then adapted to enable communities to assess the socioeconomic status of each citizen to provide a more progressive tiered premium collection system that includes full subsidies for members of the two poorest sub-categories. Ubudehe ratings account for income, household assets, and ability to work and each person is assessed collectively by the members of their village. Additionally, local leaders and 45 000 community health-care workers were incentivised to support individual enrolment in Mutuelle de Sant{\'{e}} by inclusion of district coverage levels as a key indicator in their performance-based financing scheme. Finally, a household cooperative savings mechanism (Ibimina), which was developed by one rural district, has spread throughout Rwanda, with several districts reporting that up to 40{\%} of premiums are being fully pre-paid 3 months before the start of the next financial year. Districts that use Ibimina have reduced administrative costs for Mutuelle de Sant{\'{e}} programme management, and increased participation in decision making by village residents.$\backslash$nInterpretationAs universal health coverage becomes a global health priority, countries should learn from community-level interventions to break down both financial and geographical barriers to access.$\backslash$nFundingNone.},

abstract = {Background: As universal health coverage becomes the norm in many countries, it is important to determine public priorities regarding benefits to include in health insurance coverage. We report results of participation in a decision exercise among residents of Switzerland, a high-income country with a long history of universal health insurance and deliberative democracy. Methods: We adapted the Choosing Healthplans All Together (CHAT) tool, an exercise developed to transform complex healthcare allocation decisions into easily understandable choices, for use in Switzerland. We conducted CHAT exercises in twelve Swiss cities with recruitment from a range of socio-economic backgrounds, taking into account differences in language and culture. Results: Compared to existing coverage, a majority of 175 participants accepted greater general practice gatekeeping (94{\%}), exclusion of invasive life-sustaining measures in dying patients (80{\%}), longer waiting times for non-urgent episodic care (78{\%}), greater adherence to cost-effectiveness guidelines in chronic care (66{\%}), and lower premium subsidies (51{\%}). Most initially chose greater coverage for dental care (59{\%}), quality of life (57{\%}), and long-term care (90{\%}). During group deliberations, participants increased coverage for out-of-pocket costs (58{\%}) and mental health to current levels (41{\%}) and beyond current levels for rehabilitation (50{\%}), and decreased coverage for quality of life to current levels (74{\%}). Following group deliberation, they tended to change their views back to below current coverage for help with out-of-pocket costs, and back to current levels for rehabilitation. Most participants accepted the plan as appropriate and fair. A significant number would have added nothing. Conclusion: Swiss participants who have engaged in a priority setting exercise accept complex resource allocation trade-offs in healthcare coverage. Moreover, in the context of a well-funded healthcare system with universal coverage centered on individual choice, at least some of our participants believed a fully sufficient threshold of health insurance coverage was achieved.},

abstract = {The United Nations has incorporated the noble goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Most nations have already embraced UHC as their goal. However, an intense policy debate has risen about which health system structure can best achieve UHC. Is a single-payer system more efficient, equitable and effective than a multiple-payer system for middle income countries? We argue that empirical evidence and in-depth analysis of single-payer and multiple-payer systems should inform this debate. First, we need a clear definition of single- and multiple-payer health systems that enables us to compare their differences and clarify the issues to be debated. Second, at least four key issues confront any nation that wishes to achieve UHC: (1) how to design an affordable comprehensive health benefit package for UHC and to finance it (2) how the health expenditure inflation rate can be managed to sustain UHC (3) how modern information technology can be used to enhance efficiency and quality of healthcare and (4) how to assure an adequate supply of high-quality services will be distributed equitably throughout a nation. This paper offers a definition of single- and multiple-payer and compares them. We then use Taiwan's National Health Insurance system to address the four key issues, and illuminate how its policies and operations led to Taiwan's successful UHC.},

abstract = {Objective: Excess administrative costs in the US health care system are routinely referenced as a justification for comprehensive reform. While there is agreement that these costs are too high, there is little understanding of what generates administrative costs and what policy options might mitigate them. Data Sources: Literature review and national utilization and expenditure data. Study Design: We developed a simulation model of physician billing and insurance-related (BIR) costs to estimate how certain policy reforms would generate savings. Our model is based on structural elements of the payment process in the United States and considers each provider's number of health plan contracts, the number of features in each health plan, the clinical and nonclinical processes required to submit a bill for payment, and the compliance costs associated with medical billing. Data Extraction: For several types of visits, we estimated fixed and variable costs of the billing process. We used the model to estimate the BIR costs at a national level under a variety of policy scenarios, including variations of a single payer “Medicare-for-All” model that extends fee-for-service Medicare to the entire population and policy efforts to reduce administrative costs in a multi-payer model. We conducted sensitivity analyses of a wide variety of model parameters. Principal Findings: Our model estimates that national BIR costs are reduced between 33{\%} and 53{\%} in Medicare-for-All style single-payer models and between 27{\%} and 63{\%} in various multi-payer models. Under a wide range of assumptions and sensitivity analyses, standardizing contracts generates larger savings with less variance than savings from single-payer strategies. Conclusion: Although moving toward a single-payer system will reduce BIR costs, certain reforms to payer-provider contracts could generate at least as many administrative cost savings without radically reforming the entire health system. BIR costs can be meaningfully reduced without abandoning a multi-payer system.},

abstract = {To assess the public's perceptions and attitudes about racial and ethnic differences in health care, the Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed a nationally representative sample of 3,884 whites, African Americans, and Latinos in 1999. The survey found that the majority of Americans are uninformed about health care disparities-many were unaware that blacks fare worse than whites on measures susch as infant mortality and life expectancy, and that Latinos are less likely than whites to have health insurance. Views on whether the health system treats people equally were strikingly different by race. For example, most minority Americans perceive that they get lower quality care than whites, but most whites think otherwise. Nonetheless, more minority Americans were concerned about the cost of care than racial barriers. Efforts to eliminate disparities will need to improve public awareness of the problems as well as address racial and financial barriers to care.},

abstract = {Objective: Despite the Latino electorate's increased political importance and their prominence among the uninsured population, there has been relatively little research focused on Latinos' political attitudes, particularly in the substantively important area of health policy. We examine the foundations of Latino registered voters support for universal healthcare with a particular focus on the relationship between linked fate (a form of group identity) and support for expansion of health coverage to a wider segment of the population. We theorize that the obstacles to healthcare and health coverage the Latino community faces makes health policy a Latino-salient policy area where group identity becomes relevant. Methods: We use the Latino Decisions “100 Days” 2009 survey of Latino registered voters for our analysis, an ideal data set that provides a measure of linked fate, support for universal healthcare, and several key control variables. Results: Our findings show that linked fate is a significant predictor of Latino registered voters' support for expansion of health-care coverage, suggesting that healthcare is a salient policy for the Latino community. Conclusions: Despite being a tremendously diverse population, our results suggest that Latino policy preferences can be influenced by an underlying sense of group identity when the policy area cues ethnic identity.},

abstract = {In May 2011, a year after the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Vermont became the first state to lay the groundwork for a single-payer health care system, known as Green Mountain Care. What can other states learn from the Vermont experience? This article summarizes the findings from interviews with nearly 120 stakeholders as part of a study to inform the design of the health reform legislation. Comparing Vermont's failed effort to adopt single-payer legislation in 1994 to present efforts, we find that Vermont faced similar challenges but greater opportunities in 2010 that enabled reform.Aclosely contested gubernatorial election and a progressive social movement opened a window of opportunity to advance legislation to design three comprehensive health reformoptions for legislative consideration.With a unified Democratic government under the leadership of a single-payer proponent, a high-profile policy proposal, and relatively weak opposition, a framework for a single-payer system was adopted by the legislature-though with many details and political battles to be fought in the future. Other states looking to reform their health systems more comprehensively than national reform can learn from Vermont's design and political strategy.},

abstract = {Background: Despite universal population coverage and equity being a stated policy goal of its NHIS, over a decade since passage of the first law in 2003, Ghana continues to struggle with how to attain it. The predominantly (about 70 {\%}) tax funded NHIS currently has active enrolment hovering around 40 {\%} of the population. This study explored in-depth enablers and barriers to enrolment in the NHIS to provide lessons and insights for Ghana and other low and middle income countries (LMIC) into attaining the goal of universality in Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Methods: We conducted a cross sectional mixed methods study of an urban and a rural district in one region of Southern Ghana. Data came from document review, analysis of routine data on enrolment, key informant in-depth interviews with local government, regional and district insurance scheme and provider staff and community member in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Results: Population coverage in the NHIS in the study districts was not growing towards near universal because of failure of many of those who had ever enrolled to regularly renew annually as required by the NHIS policy. Factors facilitating and enabling enrolment were driven by the design details of the scheme that emanate from national level policy and program formulation, frontline purchaser and provider staff implementation arrangements and contextual factors. The factors inter-related and worked together to affect client experience of the scheme, which were not always the same as the declared policy intent. This then also affected the decision to enrol and stay enrolled. Conclusions: UHC policy and program design needs to be such that enrolment is effectively compulsory in practice. It also requires careful attention and responsiveness to actual and potential subscriber, purchaser and provider (stakeholder) incentives and related behaviour generated at implementation levels.},

abstract = {US political debates often refer to the experience of "single-payer" systems such as those of Canada and the United Kingdom. We argue that single payer is not a very useful category in comparative health policy analysis but that the experiences of countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden, and Australia provide useful lessons. In creating universal taxfinanced systems, they teach the importance of strong, unified governments at critical junctures- most notably democratization. The United States seems politically hospitable to creating such a system. The process of creation, however, highlights the malleability of interests in the health care system, the opportunities for creative coalition building, and the problems caused by linking health care finance and reform. In maintaining these systems, keeping the middle class supportive is crucial to avoiding universal health care that is essentially a program for the poor. For a technical term from the 1970s, "single-payer health care" has proved to have remarkable political power and persistence. We argue it is not a very useful term but the lessons from such systems can be valuable for those contemplating movement toward universal health coverage in the United States.},

abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between individual-level support for the 2010 Affordable Care Act and nativism, the perception that a traditional American culture and way of life needs to be protected against foreign influence. The results of an analysis of a 2011 public opinion survey demonstrate that nativism was an independent and significant predictor of opposition to health care reform and that this effect held for both Republicans as well as Democrats, although the relationship is stronger for Republicans. This is substantively important for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that certain sub-groups of the American public evaluate public policy proposals on the basis of their perceived “foreignness.” Second, it demonstrates that while nativism is traditionally associated with immigration and other race/ethnic-based policy preferences, it also affects attitudes toward other seemingly race-neutral policies in the United States.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Managing expenditures on pharmaceuticals is important for health systems to sustain universal access to necessary medicines. We sought to estimate the size and sources of differences in expenditures on primary care medications among highincome countries with universal health care systems. METHODS: We compared data on the 2015 volume and cost per day of primary care prescription drug therapies purchased in 10 high-income countries with various systems of universal health care coverage (7 from Europe, in addition to Australia, Canada and New Zealand). We measured total per capita expenditure on 6 categories of primary care prescription drugs: hypertension treatments, pain medications, lipidlowering medicines, noninsulin diabetes treatments, gastrointestinal preparations and antidepressants. We quantified the contributions of 5 drivers of the observed differences in per capita expenditures. RESULTS: Across countries, the average annual per capita expenditure on the primary care medicines studied varied by more than 600{\%}: from {\$}23 in New Zealand to {\$}171 in Switzerland. The volume of therapies purchased varied by 41{\%}: from 198 days per capita in Norway to 279 days per capita in Germany. Most of the differences in average expenditures per capita were driven by a combination of differences in the average mix of drugs selected within therapeutic categories and differences in the prices paid for medicines prescribed. INTERPRETATION: Significant international differences in average expenditures on primary care medications are driven primarily by factors that contribute to the average daily cost of therapy, rather than differences in the volume of therapy used. Average expenditures were lower among single-payer financing systems that appeared to promote lower prices and the selection of lowercost treatment options.},

abstract = {The United States leads the world in many measures of health care innovation. However, it has been criticized to lag behind many developed nations in important health outcomes including mortality rates and higher health care costs. The surveys have shown the United States to outspend all other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries with spending on health goods and services per person of {\$}7,290 - almost 21/2 times the average of all OECD countries in 2007. Rising health care costs in the United States have been estimated to increase to 19.1{\%} of gross domestic product (GDP) or {\$}4.4 trillion by 2018. CER is defined as the generation and synthesis of evidence that compares the benefits and harms of alternate methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition or to improve the delivery of care. The, comparative effectiveness research (CER) has been touted by supporters with high expectations to resolve most ill effects of health care in the United States providing high quality, less expensive, universal health care. The efforts of CER in the United States date back to the late 1970s and it was officially inaugurated with the enactment of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA). It has been rejuvenated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 with an allocation of {\$}1.1 billion. CER has been the basis of decision for health care in many other countries. Of all the available agencies, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the United Kingdom is the most advanced, stable, and has provided significant evidence, though based on rigid and proscriptive economic and clinical formulas. While CER is taking a rapid surge in the United States, supporters and opponents are emerging expressing their views. Since interventional pain management is a new and evolving specialty, with ownership claimed by numerous organizations, at times it is felt as if it has many fathers and other times it becomes an orphan. Part 2 of this comprehensive review will provide facts, fallacies, and politics of CER along with discussion of potential outcomes, impact of CER on health care delivery, and implications for interventional pain management in the United States.},

@article{Odokonyero2017,
abstract = {Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has gained popularity within the global health policy and academic circles as countries strive to meet the UHC target established under the Sustainable Development Goal agenda. To accomplish this goal, developing countries such as Rwanda, Ghana and others have pursued bold policy initiatives including the introduction of health insurance schemes. In addition to financing, presence of critical health infrastructure and Human Resources for Health (HRH) are crucial to achieving UHC. Using administrative data from IntraHealth Uganda Country Programme (as well as document review) and the Demographic {\&} Health Survey data, this paper analysed Uganda's critical health infrastructure (including HRH) needed to attain sustained progress towards UHC. It also reviewed UHC progress and analysed equity by computing Composite Coverage Index (CCI) and Coverage Gap Scores. Results show fundamental challenges with the health infrastructure needed to deliver UHC in Uganda. Spatial inequality exists in health facility population coverage and private sector health infrastructure investments. Low health workforce density imply that the existing health workforce is deficient and unable to expand population-based healthcare services. Progress towards UHC [considering reproductive, maternal, new-born, and child health (RMCH) interventions] has improved marginally over the reviewed period, although the CCI remained low, and regional and socio-economic disparities in coverage remained. Findings also demonstrate that improved healthcare coverage corresponds to better health outcomes. Accelerating progress towards UHC require; increased investments in health infrastructure and strengthening Public Private Partnership arrangements to establish health infrastructure in disadvantaged regions; and improvement in health workforce density by reviewing current staffing norms for critical cadres as well as increased deliberate investments in HRH using similar initiatives like the HRH programme model of Rwanda. To scale up healthcare coverage for RMCH, interventions should aim to maintain successes obtained for immunization and address existing gaps in lagging intervention areas. These objectives can only be achieved if the country institutes and effectively implements a coherent set of health sector policy reforms, regarding health financing, for instance, while drawing lessons from the successful policy efforts observed in the Rwandan case scenario.},
